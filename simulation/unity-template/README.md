# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Unity HDRP Template

This Unity project template uses the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook examples. It provides a foundation for creating high-fidelity digital twin environments and robot visualization.

## Features

- High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) configuration
- Optimized for robotics visualization
- Sample scene with basic lighting and camera setup
- HDRP-specific post-processing settings
- Ready for integration with ROS-Unity bridge
